! LAM 6.3 beta 2 contains external PMPI_WTIME, PMPI_WTICK in mpif.h but
! does not define those routines in the library.  This causes an unresoved
! reference error with some compilers.  This file contains dummy routines
! for them to resolve the symbols.

      subroutine pmpi_wtime()
      end subroutine pmpi_wtime

      subroutine pmpi_wtick()
      end subroutine pmpi_wtick
